# ðŸ”§ Method Lookup Error Fix

## Issue Identified
The error "Lookup failed: fetchAllFertilizers in @methods in ApiService" suggests that the Dart runtime can't find these methods, even though they exist in the code.

## Root Cause
This typically happens when:
1. Hot reload doesn't pick up new method additions
2. Dart analyzer cache issues
3. Flutter framework cache issues

## Fix Required
**RESTART the app completely** instead of using hot reload:

### Option 1: Stop and Restart
1. Stop the running app completely
2. Run `flutter run` again

### Option 2: Hot Restart (Recommended)
1. In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+F5` (or `Cmd+Shift+F5` on Mac)
2. Or click the "Hot Restart" button (ðŸ”„) in debug toolbar

### Option 3: Full Clean (If above doesn't work)
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Methods Verified âœ…
- `fetchAllFertilizers()` - Line 963 in api_service.dart âœ…
- `fetchCrops()` - Line 528 in api_service.dart âœ…
- Both methods are properly defined with correct signatures
- All imports are correct
- No syntax errors in the code

## Why This Happens
Flutter's hot reload is great for UI changes but sometimes misses:
- New method additions to existing classes
- Changes in method signatures
- Import changes
- Deep dependency changes

**Hot restart** reloads the entire Dart isolate and picks up all code changes.

**Action Required**: Please do a **Hot Restart** of your app to resolve the method lookup issue!
