# AgriAI App - Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Crop Disease Detection
- ✅ Created model class for crop diseases (`crop_disease.dart`)
- ✅ Implemented disease detection service with TensorFlow integration (`disease_detection_service.dart`)
- ✅ Created UI for disease detection (`disease_detection_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Added detection history functionality
- ✅ Integrated with Firebase for storing detection results
- ✅ Added labels file for disease classification

### 2. Soil-Based Crop Recommendation
- ✅ Created crop recommendation service that uses CSV data (`crop_recommendation_service.dart`)
- ✅ Implemented algorithm to match soil parameters with suitable crops
- ✅ Developed UI for soil parameter input (`soil_based_recommendation_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Added result display with crop details
- ✅ Integrated CSV data file as an asset

### 3. Dashboard Enhancements
- ✅ Added new feature cards for disease detection and soil-based recommendation
- ✅ Updated routes for navigation
- ✅ Initialized services in app startup

## Pending Tasks

### 1. TensorFlow Lite Model
- ⬜ Need to add actual TensorFlow Lite model file (crop_disease_model.tflite)
- ⬜ Implement proper image processing and model inference in disease detection service

### 2. Testing and Refinement
- ⬜ Test disease detection with real images
- ⬜ Test crop recommendation with various soil parameters
- ⬜ Optimize UI for different screen sizes

### 3. Additional Features
- ⬜ AI Assistant for farming advice
- ⬜ Connect soil recommendation with local weather data
- ⬜ Add crop rotation recommendations

## Next Steps
1. Obtain or train a TensorFlow Lite model for crop disease detection
2. Test the app with real data and refine the algorithms
3. Enhance the UI based on user feedback
4. Implement remaining features as prioritized by users
